Efficient Trie Implementation: O(m) search complexity where m is prefix length

Machine Learning Integration: Frequency-based ranking and context prediction

Auto-correction: Intelligent error correction using edit distance algorithms

Persistent Learning: Save and load learned patterns to files

Cross-platform: Pure C++ implementation with no external dependencies

✨ Features
🔍 Core Functionality
Autocomplete Suggestions: Fast prefix-based word completion

Algorithm Complexity
Operation	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Insert	O(m)	O(ALPHABET_SIZE × N × M)
Search	O(m)	O(1)
Autocomplete	O(m + k)	O(k)
Auto-correct	O(m × n)	O(k)
Where m = word length, n = edit distance, k = number of suggestions, N = number of words, M = average word length

🧠 Machine Learning Components
1. Frequency-Based Learning
cpp
// Words get higher priority based on usage
void userSelectedWord(const std::string& word) {
    insertWord(word, 5); // Boost frequency significantly
}
2. Context Prediction
cpp
// Predicts next words based on sentence context
std::vector<std::string> predictNextWord(const std::string& context) {
    // Analyzes last word and suggests appropriate continuations
    // Example: "I am" → suggests verbs like "going", "running", etc.
}
3. Auto-correction Algorithm
cpp
// Uses edit distance with frequency weighting
std::string autoCorrect(const std::string& word) {
    // Finds closest matches considering both spelling similarity
    // and word frequency in the learned model
}
4. Reinforcement Learning
Positive Feedback: Selected words get frequency boost

Pattern Recognition: System learns user preferences

Adaptive Ranking: Suggestions reorder based on usage patterns

#define MAX_SUGGESTIONS 10        // Maximum suggestions returned
#define MAX_EDIT_DISTANCE 2       // Auto-correction sensitivity  
#define FREQUENCY_BOOST 5         // Learning rate for user selections
#define MIN_WORD_LENGTH 1         // Minimum word length to store
Runtime Configuration
cpp
// Adjust suggestion count
auto suggestions = system.getSuggestions("prefix", 8); // Get 8 suggestions

// Control learning rate
system.insertWord("word", 15); // High frequency boost
